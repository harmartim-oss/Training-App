## Understanding Consent Requirements

### What is Meaningful Consent?

Meaningful consent under PIPEDA requires that individuals:
- **Know** what information is being collected
- **Understand** why it's being collected and how it will be used
- **Have control** over the collection and use of their information
- **Receive clear and simple information** about privacy practices

### Key Principles

#### 1. **Transparency**
- Clear, plain language explanations
- No hidden clauses or fine print
- Easily accessible privacy information

#### 2. **Control**
- Ability to say "no" or withdraw consent
- Granular choices where possible
- No negative consequences for withholding consent for optional purposes

#### 3. **Timing**
- Consent obtained at or before collection
- Just-in-time notices for specific activities
- Re-consent when purposes change
