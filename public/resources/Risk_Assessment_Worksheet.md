## Risk Assessment Matrix

### Risk Rating Calculation

**Risk Score = Likelihood × Impact**

| Score | Rating |
|-------|--------|
| 1-4 | Low |
| 5-9 | Medium |
| 10-16 | High |
| 17-25 | Critical |

### Likelihood Scale (1-5)

| Level | Description | Frequency |
|-------|-------------|-----------|
| 1 - Rare | Highly unlikely to occur | < 1% annually |
| 2 - Unlikely | Could occur but not expected | 1-10% annually |
| 3 - Possible | Might occur occasionally | 10-30% annually |
| 4 - Likely | Expected to occur | 30-70% annually |
| 5 - Almost Certain | Will occur, repeatedly | > 70% annually |

### Impact Scale (1-5)

| Level | Description | Consequences |
|-------|-------------|--------------|
| 1 - Minimal | Negligible impact | Minor inconvenience, < $10K loss |
| 2 - Minor | Limited impact | Short disruption, $10K-$50K loss |
| 3 - Moderate | Noticeable impact | Several hours disruption, $50K-$250K loss |
| 4 - Major | Significant impact | Days of disruption, $250K-$1M loss, reputation damage |
| 5 - Severe | Catastrophic impact | Weeks disruption, > $1M loss, major reputation/legal impact |

## Risk Identification

### Asset Inventory

List critical assets requiring protection:

| Asset ID | Asset Name | Type | Owner | Criticality (1-5) |
|----------|------------|------|-------|-------------------|
| A001 | | Data/System/Service | | |
| A002 | | | | |
| A003 | | | | |

### Threat Identification

Common threats to consider:

- ☐ Malware/Ransomware
- ☐ Phishing/Social Engineering
- ☐ Unauthorized Access
- ☐ Data Breach/Exfiltration
- ☐ Denial of Service
- ☐ Insider Threat
- ☐ Physical Security Breach
- ☐ Third-Party/Supply Chain
- ☐ Natural Disaster
- ☐ Hardware/Software Failure

**Risk ID**: ___________

- ☐ **Mitigate**: Implement controls to reduce likelihood or impact
- ☐ **Accept**: Accept risk if within tolerance
- ☐ **Transfer**: Transfer risk (insurance, outsourcing)
- ☐ **Avoid**: Eliminate activity causing risk
