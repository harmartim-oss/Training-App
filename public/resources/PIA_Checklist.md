Version: 1.0  
Prepared for: [Municipality / Service Name]  
Prepared by: [Name / Role]  
Date: [YYYY-MM-DD]

## Purpose
This PIA checklist helps municipal project teams assess privacy risks and design mitigations for new programs, systems, third-party contracts, cloud services, or data-sharing initiatives.

## Scope & When to Complete a PIA
Complete a PIA when a project:
- Collects personal information (PI) not previously gathered.
- Introduces new uses/disclosures of PI.
- Transfers PI across jurisdictions (especially outside Canada).
- Integrates systems or shares datasets that increase re-identification risk.
- Uses new technologies (AI, biometrics, IoT, CCTV).
- Has the potential to impact vulnerable populations.

## Stakeholders to Engage
- Project sponsor / business owner
- Privacy officer / access coordinator
- IT / security lead
- Records management / archives
- Legal counsel
- Third-party vendors (if involved)
- Affected program managers / user representatives

## High-level PIA Sections (and checklist items)

1. Project summary
   - [ ] Describe the project purpose, scope, and business need
   - [ ] Identify project owners and stakeholders
   - [ ] List external partners and vendors

2. Personal information inventory
   - [ ] List data elements collected (names, identifiers, images, financial, health, etc.)
   - [ ] Map data flows (collection points, processing, storage, transfers)
   - [ ] Identify data sources (public, self-reported, third-party)

3. Legal authority & purpose
   - [ ] Identify statutory authority or policy permitting collection/use
   - [ ] Document the specific purposes for collection
   - [ ] Confirm that collection/use is necessary and proportionate to the purpose

4. Consent & notice
   - [ ] Describe how notice is provided to individuals
   - [ ] Document how consent is obtained, where required (form, implied, opt-out)
   - [ ] Identify any special requirements for minors or vulnerable groups

5. Retention & disposal
   - [ ] State retention periods and legal/schedule authority
   - [ ] Describe secure disposal methods at end-of-life

6. Access & correction
   - [ ] Explain how individuals will request access or correction
   - [ ] Identify processes to handle third-party or FOI requests

7. Disclosure & sharing
   - [ ] List internal and external recipients of PI
   - [ ] For each recipient, record purpose and legal basis
   - [ ] Document safeguards for any cross-border transfers

8. Security & safeguards
   - Administrative:
     - [ ] Role-based access and least privilege
     - [ ] Policies, training, and incident response plan
     - [ ] Vendor due diligence and contractual requirements (security, subprocessing)
   - Technical:
     - [ ] Encryption at rest and in transit where appropriate
     - [ ] Strong authentication controls
     - [ ] Logging and monitoring
   - Physical:
     - [ ] Secure premises, locked storage, device security

9. Risk assessment
   - [ ] Identify privacy risks (likelihood & impact)
   - [ ] Evaluate risk level (e.g., Low / Medium / High)
   - [ ] Prioritize risks for mitigation

10. Mitigation plan
    - For each risk, provide:
      - [ ] Mitigation measure(s)
      - [ ] Responsible owner
      - [ ] Target implementation date
      - [ ] Residual risk rating

11. Data subject rights & special considerations
    - [ ] Address access, correction, portability (if applicable)
    - [ ] Consider anonymization/pseudonymization if useful
    - [ ] Consider retention exemptions or special handling for health or sensitive data

12. Oversight & sign-off
    - [ ] Review by Privacy Officer / Access Coordinator
    - [ ] Review by IT/Security lead
    - [ ] Legal review if needed
    - [ ] Senior sponsor sign-off

13. Implementation monitoring
    - [ ] Post-implementation review scheduled (e.g., 3â€“6 months)
    - [ ] Audit logging & KPIs for privacy controls
    - [ ] Update PIA if scope or technology changes

## Risk Matrix (example)
| Risk Description | Likelihood | Impact | Risk Rating | Mitigation |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| Unauthorized access to citizen records | Medium | High | High | Role-based access, MFA, encryption, log review |

(Use this table pattern to capture the top 5-10 risks.)
