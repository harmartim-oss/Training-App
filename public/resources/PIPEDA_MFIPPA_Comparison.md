## When Both Apply

In rare circumstances, both PIPEDA and MFIPPA might apply to the same organization:

1. **Municipal Corporation Operating Commercially**
   - MFIPPA applies to municipal functions
   - PIPEDA may apply to commercial activities (e.g., selling services)

2. **Resolution**
   - Substantially similar provisions: Provincial law prevails
   - Different standards: Must comply with both
   - Seek legal advice when overlap occurs
