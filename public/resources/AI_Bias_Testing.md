# AI Bias Testing Checklist

Practical checklist for identifying and testing algorithmic bias across demographic groups.

## Pre-Deployment Testing

### Data Quality Assessment
- ☐ Training data demographics documented
- ☐ Underrepresented groups identified
- ☐ Data collection bias assessed
- ☐ Historical bias in data evaluated

### Fairness Metrics
- ☐ Demographic parity calculated
- ☐ Equal opportunity metrics measured
- ☐ Predictive parity assessed
- ☐ Calibration across groups verified

### Protected Characteristics Testing
Test system performance across:
- ☐ Race/Ethnicity
- ☐ Gender
- ☐ Age
- ☐ Disability status
- ☐ Geographic location
- ☐ Socioeconomic status

### Intersectional Analysis
- ☐ Multiple protected characteristics combined
- ☐ Subgroup analysis performed
- ☐ Edge cases identified

## Bias Mitigation

### Pre-Processing
- ☐ Data resampling
- ☐ Synthetic data generation
- ☐ Feature selection review

### In-Processing
- ☐ Fairness constraints added to model
- ☐ Adversarial debiasing applied
- ☐ Regularization techniques used

### Post-Processing
- ☐ Threshold optimization per group
- ☐ Score recalibration
- ☐ Decision rule adjustment

## Ongoing Monitoring
- ☐ Regular fairness audits scheduled
- ☐ Performance metrics tracked by group
- ☐ Drift detection implemented
- ☐ Feedback mechanism established
