        "üí° **PIPEDA Key Requirements**: Under PIPEDA, organizations must identify purposes for collecting personal information **before or at the time of collection** to ensure transparency. Consent must be meaningful - individuals must understand what they're agreeing to. Organizations can only collect, use, and disclose personal information for purposes that a reasonable person would consider appropriate in the circumstances.",
        
        "‚öñÔ∏è **PIPEDA Penalties**: Recent amendments under Bill C-27 significantly increase penalties. Maximum fines are now $100,000 for individuals and $10 million for organizations. The Privacy Commissioner also has enhanced investigation powers and can make compliance orders that are enforceable in Federal Court."

        "üîí **MFIPPA Data Storage Rules**: Section 30.1 requires that personal information under municipal control must be **stored and accessed only within Canada**. Limited exceptions include: disclosure authorized under sections 29 or 31, written consent from individual, information available to general public, or Commissioner authorization. This is critical for cloud services - you must verify data residency with providers.",
        
        "üìä **Privacy Impact Assessments under MFIPPA**: PIAs are mandatory for new programs involving personal information collection. The process includes: threshold assessment, data mapping, risk assessment, mitigation strategies, and monitoring plans. Key triggers include new technology implementations, data sharing agreements, and cross-border transfers."

        "‚öñÔ∏è **Algorithmic Impact Assessments (AIAs)**: Required for high-impact AI systems, AIAs evaluate potential risks including bias, privacy impacts, and unintended consequences. The assessment covers: system purpose and functionality, data sources and quality, potential impacts on individuals and groups, mitigation measures, and ongoing monitoring requirements.",

    'data management': [

        "üìÖ **Records Retention Policies**: Must balance legal requirements, operational needs, and storage costs. Key elements include: retention schedules based on record type, legal holds for litigation, secure disposal procedures, and regular reviews. For municipalities, retention schedules must comply with provincial requirements and Municipal Act provisions.",
        
        "üåê **Cross-Border Data Compliance**: When transferring data internationally, consider: destination country privacy laws, adequacy decisions (EU), data processing agreements with clear privacy terms, additional safeguards for sensitive data, and ongoing monitoring of compliance. For MFIPPA-covered organizations, remember the strict Canadian storage requirement."
